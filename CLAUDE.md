# MicrobeLab

Microbiology adventure for tweens with microscope-zoom-as-core-loop, microbiome simulator, named microbe characters, and an immune-response minigame — beneficial microbes foregrounded, COVID-trauma-sensitive.

> **🚫 Xcode-managed files — DO NOT AUTHOR / EDIT (staging + committing IS fine)**: the agent operates from inside the Xcode workspace. **NEVER write** the following files. **`git add` + `git commit` on Xcode-regenerated diffs IS fine** — the prohibition is on authoring/editing the file content from disk.

Build verification of SPM-only changes uses `swift build --package-path Packages/Libraries` (terminal, no Xcode reload) — NOT `xcodebuild` (forces Xcode workspace reload, terminates the agent session). See `@.claude/rules/xcode-agent-safety.md` for the full classification table + safe escape hatches.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift 6 (strict concurrency)
- **UI**: SwiftUI
- **AI**: FoundationModels (on-device)
- **Persistence**: SwiftData
- **Testing**: Swift Testing (`@Test`, `#expect`)
- **Min Target**: iOS 26 / Xcode 26
- **Architecture**: App shell + local Swift Package (`Packages/Libraries/Package.swift`)
- **Framework**: ForgeKit (pinned via `.package(url:, from: "0.99.0")`)

Portfolio-wide tech stack rules live in `@.claude/rules/forgekit.md` + `@.claude/rules/concurrency.md` + `@.claude/rules/swiftui.md` + `@.claude/rules/swiftdata.md` + `@.claude/rules/spritekit.md` + `@.claude/rules/foundationmodels.md`. All auto-load with this file.

## Commands

```bash
# SPM-only build (no Xcode reload — preferred for in-IDE agent verification)
swift build --package-path Packages/Libraries

# Full app build (iOS Simulator) — use MCP `BuildProject` when Xcode is open
xcodebuild -workspace MicrobeLab.xcworkspace -scheme MicrobeLab \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' build

# Tests
xcodebuild test -workspace MicrobeLab.xcworkspace -scheme MicrobeLab \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'
```

When this repo's Coding Assistant session is operating from inside Xcode, prefer in this order:

1. **`swift build --package-path Packages/Libraries`** for SPM-only changes (terminal-only, no workspace reload — safest path for the in-IDE agent)
2. **MCP `BuildProject` / `RunSomeTests`** when broader build coverage (app shell + Xcode-resolved targets) is needed
3. **`xcodebuild`** only when MCP isn't available — it triggers a workspace reload and can terminate the agent session mid-task

See `@.claude/rules/xcode-agent-safety.md` for the full classification of Xcode-managed files the agent must never author from disk, and `@.claude/rules/workflow.md` § "MCP-First Testing Workflow" for testing flow details.

## App-Specific Conventions

See `@Docs/APP_SPECIFIC_NOTES.md` for the preserved prior CLAUDE.md content (architecture / domain patterns / gotchas accumulated through development). Portfolio-wide rules — Swift 6 concurrency, SwiftData patterns, testing conventions, ForgeKit module APIs, Liquid Glass register, distributed-narrative methodology, trauma-informed gates, COPPA / age-assurance — auto-load from `@.claude/rules/` (24+ files synced from labsmith). Do NOT re-state portfolio-wide rules here.

## SPM Folder Convention

The local Swift Package at `Packages/Libraries/` follows the portfolio standard layout per `@.claude/rules/spm-architecture.md`. Source files live directly under `Sources/<TargetName>/` and may optionally be grouped into subdirectories when a target accumulates many files. Current per-target subdirectory groupings shipped through Phase 1:

| Target | Subdirectories | Convention |
|---|---|---|
| `AppFeature` | `Onboarding/`, `Profile/` (`ProfileView` + `AvatarStudioSheet`), `Settings/` (`SettingsView` + `ParentalGateView`), `Engagement/` | One subdir per cross-cutting feature surface — pages / sheets / overlays. Tab views without supplementary files (Explore / Codex / Microbiome / Progress / Immune / Quiz) stay at root |
| `Services` | `Engagement/` (`GamificationService` + `LastActiveStore` + `SessionCountStore` + `SessionTargetService` + `StreakStore` + `VariableRewardSelector`) | Engagement-foundation stores cluster under one subdir; root holds `AppSettings` / `MicrobeCatalogService` / `OnboardingStore` / `QuestionKitService` / `DebugLog` + `Resources/` |
| `Models` / `SharedUI` / `GameEngine` / `AIMentor` | flat | Files at target root; promote to subdirs when count > ~12 OR a logical cluster emerges |

When introducing a new feature surface that owns ≥ 3 files (view + machine + service), create a subdirectory rather than inflating the root file list. Reorganization is FREE in SPM — no Xcode project membership to update.

## Xcode-managed file safety (reinforced 2026-06-12 — third pass, user-direct)

**Critical** (verbatim user-direct, 2026-06-12 — repeated across three reinforcement passes the same day): *"do not author/edit xcode-managed files including Xcode workspace file and Xcode scheme/test plan file. staging and committing is ok."* The fact that the user has now re-stated this rule three times in a single day is itself the signal: this is THE most load-bearing safety rule for the in-IDE agent. Treat any future ambiguity around an `.xcworkspace` / `.xcscheme` / `.xctestplan` / `.pbxproj` / `Info.plist` / `.entitlements` / asset-catalog `Contents.json` / `Package.resolved` / `xcuserdata/` edit as a STOP and route through `Docs/HANDOFF_TO_USER_<TOPIC>.md` describing the Xcode GUI steps — never attempt the edit.

The named files at the top of this file remain off-limits to the agent for authoring/editing from disk. Specifically called out by name in today's reinforcement:

- `MicrobeLab.xcworkspace/contents.xcworkspacedata` — Xcode workspace membership; editing forces workspace reload, can terminate the agent session
- `MicrobeLab.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — project membership; system hook blocks edits while Xcode is open
- `*.xcscheme` (anywhere) — scheme JSON; Xcode caches in memory and overwrites disk edits on save
- `MicrobeLab.xctestplan` — Xcode-managed test plan JSON; route changes through Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Test → Test Plans GUI

**`git add` + `git commit` on Xcode-regenerated diffs IS fine** — only authoring/editing the file content from disk is prohibited. Verify SPM-only changes with `swift build --package-path Packages/Libraries` (NEVER `xcodebuild` from inside the Xcode-hosted agent — it terminates the session). Use MCP `BuildProject` when broader build coverage is required.

Any change that requires a managed file (new test target wiring, new app capability, new asset catalog entry, new scheme) ships via `Docs/HANDOFF_TO_USER_<TOPIC>.md` instead of an attempted direct edit. The canonical handoff doc at `@Docs/HANDOFF_TO_USER_XCODE_GUI_TASKS.md` aggregates open GUI tasks.

Engagement-foundation work landing in the same round (Session nudge / Progressive disclosure / Streak persistence + rescue / Variable rewards / SPM folder refresh — PRs #35 / #36 / #37 / #38 / #40) stayed entirely inside `Packages/Libraries/Sources/` + `Docs/` — no managed-file edits required. The parent-handoff flow (PR #42) + retention-metrics baseline (PR #43) extended that same discipline. The same discipline applies for follow-up engagement + onboarding work; if a new XCUITest launch-argument needs scheme wiring, ship the change via a `Docs/HANDOFF_TO_USER_<TOPIC>.md` describing the Xcode GUI steps.

### Self-check before every edit

Before any `Edit` / `Write` tool call, the agent answers two questions internally:

1. Does the target path match any glob in the table at the top of this file (workspace / pbxproj / scheme / test plan / Info.plist / entitlements / asset-catalog Contents.json / xcuserdata / Package.resolved)?
2. If yes — STOP. Route the change through `Docs/HANDOFF_TO_USER_<TOPIC>.md` and surface the GUI steps to the user. Never attempt the edit "just to see if it works".

If no — proceed. SPM source under `Packages/Libraries/Sources/<Target>/`, SPM tests under `Packages/Libraries/Tests/<TargetTests>/`, markdown under `Docs/` + `.claude/rules/` + `CLAUDE.md`, JSON resources under `Packages/Libraries/Sources/Services/Resources/`, scripts, `.gitignore`, `ExportOptions.plist` at repo root are all SAFE.
