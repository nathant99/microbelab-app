# Implementation Handoff — MicrobeLab

> **Seventh-pass rule-restatement summary** (top-of-doc per the seven-pass invariant codified 2026-06-12; verbatim user-direct, repeated SEVEN times in one calendar day — all-time portfolio record): *"critical: do not author/edit xcode-managed files including Xcode workspace file and Xcode scheme/test plan file. staging and committing is ok."* Scope: `*.xcworkspace/contents.xcworkspacedata` / `*.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` / `*.xcscheme` / `*.xctestplan` / `Info.plist` / `*.entitlements` / `*.xcassets/Contents.json` / `xcuserdata/` / `Package.resolved`. Every round-document the agent emits in the cadence window carries this summary so the next round inherits the cadence without re-reading the entire CLAUDE.md. See `@CLAUDE.md` § Xcode-managed file safety for the canonical statement.

**Status**: Phase 1 effectively shipped. Round 0 (scaffold) shipped 2026-05-22; Phase 1 systems landed via PRs #11 → #71 (through 2026-06-12). The bulk of Phase 1 engineering is complete; remaining work is asset-bundle-blocked (12-microbe portrait pack) or follow-on polish (UI tests, real-device perf capture).

**Latest round (2026-06-12, PRs #68 → #71, seventh-pass auto-cycle sweep)**: 4-PR sweep driven by the user-direct standing auto-cycle (`branch → commit → push → gh pr create → gh pr merge → verify`) paired with the **seventh-pass** Xcode-managed file safety reinforcement + the persisted maximize-ForgeKit-integration + close-FEATURE_PLAN-checkboxes + follow-technical-design-doc + SPM-folder-structure directive set. Each PR landed end-to-end before the next branched. Seven restatements in one calendar day is the all-time portfolio record for any single rule. Rollup:

| PR | Theme |
|---|---|
| #68 | **Seventh-pass** Xcode-managed file safety reinforcement — codifies the **seven-pass invariant** (supersedes the six-pass invariant). New rule: when the same safety rule has been restated seven times in a single calendar day, the agent re-affirms the rule (verbatim user-direct quote + scope table reference) at the top of every round-document it emits (PR descriptions, every new `HANDOFF_TO_USER_<TOPIC>.md`, `Docs/IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md` rollup top, `Docs/FEATURE_PLAN.md` prologue). Markdown decay risk is now structurally mitigated by per-round re-affirmation rather than relying on a future session reading CLAUDE.md first. |
| #69 | SpriteView VoiceOver labels — closes the high-priority GAP 1 from `Docs/AUDIT_ACCESSIBILITY_PASS_2026-06-12.md` § Findings. `ExploreView` / `MicrobiomeView` / `ImmuneGameView` each carry a top-level `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain) + .accessibilityLabel(...) + .accessibilityValue(...)` envelope so VoiceOver users land on a named canvas + hear dynamic state on each state change (tier snap / feeding-mode change + tick / wave + score + pathogens-remaining). FEATURE_PLAN § Quality "Accessibility audit" GAP 1 follow-up closed. |
| #70 | ForgeReporting wire-up — parent-facing standards-mapped progress report (engagement skeleton). `ProgressReportService` (Services/Engagement/, pure nonisolated value type wrapping `ForgeReporting.ForgeReportGenerator`) + `ProgressReportView` (AppFeature/Settings/) under a new "For parents" section gated behind the existing parental-gate math gate. Plumbing: `AppRootView` builds a `ProgressReportSnapshot` from live engagement signals + threads through `ProfileView(progressReportSnapshot:)` → `SettingsView(progressReportSnapshot:)`. Per-standard proficiency (strengths / growth areas) follows when per-question attempt logs land; today's surface is the engagement skeleton. 7 new `ProgressReportServiceTests`. Closes (partial) FEATURE_PLAN § Parent Integration → "Progress dashboard". |
| #71 | ForgeSensory wire-up — juice layer (haptic + audio-ready axis). `SensoryPaletteCoordinator` (Services/Engagement/, MainActor `@Observable`) wraps `ForgeSensory.SensoryPalette`. `AppRootView` instantiates one coordinator + threads through MicrobeCodexView → QuizView and MicrobiomeView → ImmuneGameView. Per-event wiring: QuizView fires `.correctAnswer` / `.incorrectAnswer` / `.achievement` / `.challengeComplete`; MicrobiomeView fires `.achievement`; ImmuneGameView fires `.streakMilestone(wave)` / `.challengeComplete` / `.achievement`. Audio dispatch defaults nil until the SFX pack lands per `.claude/rules/forgekit.md` § Asset generation ownership; haptic axis fires immediately via `ForgeHapticEngine.shared`. Trauma-informed: incorrect haptic is the canonical soft tap, never punitive. 6 new `SensoryPaletteCoordinatorTests`. Closes (partial — visual + haptic axes) FEATURE_PLAN § Delight & Polish → "Juice layer". |

Net additions: 2 new Services modules (`ProgressReportService` + `SensoryPaletteCoordinator`, both under `Services/Engagement/` per the portfolio SPM folder convention) + 1 new AppFeature module (`ProgressReportView` under `AppFeature/Settings/`) + 13 new unit tests across 2 suites (`ProgressReportServiceTests` + `SensoryPaletteCoordinatorTests`) + 2 ForgeKit modules promoted from declared-but-unused → actively consumed (`ForgeReporting` → Services; `ForgeSensory` → Services). Build green at each merge.

**Previous round (2026-06-12, PRs #63 → #66, sixth-pass auto-cycle sweep)**: 4-PR sweep driven by the user-direct standing auto-cycle paired with the **sixth-pass** Xcode-managed file safety reinforcement + an explicit maximize-ForgeKit-integration + close-FEATURE_PLAN-checkboxes + follow-technical-design-doc + SPM-folder-structure directive set. Rollup:

| PR | Theme |
|---|---|
| #63 | **Sixth-pass** Xcode-managed file safety reinforcement — codifies the **six-pass invariant** (when a single safety rule is restated six times in one calendar day, every subsequent session treats it as an immutable pre-flight check + every subsequent handoff doc carries a rule-restatement summary at the top so the cadence is inherited without re-reading the entire CLAUDE.md). Adds two new 6th-pass interaction notes (SPM folder-structure + technical-design-doc) clarifying that neither directive extends to managed-file edits. Also commits the Xcode-regenerated diff to `MicrobeLab.xctestplan` that wires the `SharedUITests` SPM test target from PR #59 — per the rule, staging+committing the Xcode-regenerated diff IS fine. Closes `HANDOFF_TO_USER_XCODE_GUI_TASKS.md` § 6. |
| #64 | ForgeAnalytics on-device privacy-first event totals — closes the "still declared but unused" gap from § ForgeKit Integration Status. Adds `AnalyticsService` (MainActor `@Observable` wrapper around the `ForgeAnalytics.AnalyticsEngine` actor) under `Services/Engagement/` + a canonical `MicrobeLabAnalyticsEvent` enum with grep-able snake_case event names + PII-safe property bags (counts + slugs only). Wires `AppRootView` (session start/end on scenePhase), `ExploreView` (zoom_tier_reached on every microscope snap), `MicrobiomeView` (feeding_mode_changed + microbiome_milestone every 5th tick + achievement_earned per ForgeGamification unlock), and `ImmuneGameView` (immune_wave_cleared per wave + immune_run_completed on full-run clear). 12 new `@Test` covering init defaults + session lifecycle + per-event name mapping + accumulation + activeDays plumbing + ZoomTier slug stability + property-bag PII discipline. |
| #65 | ForgeSpotlight indexing for the 12-microbe codex — closes the "still declared but unused" ForgeSpotlight gap. Adds `MicrobeSpotlightItem` (pure `SpotlightIndexable` adapter; stable slug-based `spotlightID` so UUID churn doesn't fragment the index) + `MicrobeSpotlightIndex` (MainActor `@Observable` wrapper around `ForgeSpotlightIndexer`). `AppRootView.loadCatalog()` indexes the catalog on every cold launch; ForgeSpotlight dedupes via `spotlightID`. Trauma-informed posture mirrors `MicrobeCodexView`: entire catalog indexed (the codex already shows all 12 cards from launch — locked entries render as "???"); locked microbes still gate the fact card behind discovery once landed. Privacy: `CSSearchableIndex` is on-device per `.claude/rules/age-assurance.md`; keywords ship stable enum slugs only (pinned by `spotlightKeywordsContainOnlyStableEnumSlugs` invariant). 7 new `@Test`. |
| #66 | Mentor personality callbacks — closes the FEATURE_PLAN § Delight & Polish → "Character personality" item. Adds `MentorRecallStore` (UserDefaults-persisted ring buffer of recently-met microbe slugs; cap 5; FIFO recency dedup) + `VeeMentor.recallCue(for:daysSinceLastSeen:)` (warm trauma-informed callback copy with day-bucket pivots 0 / 1 / 2-6 / 7+ — "still hanging around" / "still here when you're ready" — never "you abandoned us" or loss-aversion). `ExploreView.init()` prefers a recall callback over the variable-reward / default cold-open copy when the store has entries; `ExploreView.onAppear` records rare-microbe-sighting slugs into the store so subsequent cold opens can quote them. 8 new `@Test` for the store + 6 new `@Test` for the cue (pinning the trauma-safe no-abandonment-words discipline). |

Net additions: 2 new Services modules (`AnalyticsService` + `MicrobeSpotlightIndex` + `MentorRecallStore` — the last two land flat at the Services root + under `Services/Engagement/` respectively per the SPM folder convention) + 1 new SharedUITests xctestplan wiring (Xcode GUI) + 33 new unit tests across 4 suites + 3 ForgeKit modules promoted from declared-but-unused → actively consumed (`ForgeAnalytics` → Services, `ForgeSpotlight` → Services; the recall surface extends the existing `ForgeAI`-fronted `VeeMentor`). Build green at each merge.

**Previous round (2026-06-12, PRs #58 → #61, fifth-pass auto-cycle)**: 4-PR sweep driven by the user-direct standing auto-cycle paired with the fifth-pass Xcode-managed file safety reinforcement + maximize-ForgeKit-integration + close-FEATURE_PLAN-checkboxes directive. Rollup:

| PR | Theme |
|---|---|
| #58 | Xcode-managed file safety — **fifth-pass** reinforcement (CLAUDE.md / `xcode-agent-safety.md` / `HANDOFF_TO_USER_XCODE_GUI_TASKS.md`). Codifies the five-pass invariant (when a single safety rule is restated five times in one day it becomes a pre-flight check, not a guideline) + the maximize-ForgeKit-integration interaction note (ForgeKit SPM-only wiring stays safe; modules needing entitlements still route through `HANDOFF_TO_USER_XCODE_GUI_TASKS.md`). |
| #59 | ForgePedagogy hint scaffolding in QuizView — first kid-facing consumer of the previously-declared `ForgePedagogy` ForgeKit module. `QuestionHintStrategy` (SharedUI/, pure `nonisolated` value-type) derives per-tier hint text from a `Question`: vague leans on the curriculum-standard tag; medium returns the first sentence of the explanation with the correct-choice phrase elided; specific returns the full explanation. `QuizMachine` extended with `requestedHintTier` + `hintsUsedCount` + `nextRequestableHintTier` + `requestNextHint()`. `QuizView` adds a "Hint" button next to "Check" + an inline yellow-tinted hint card + a trauma-informed completion summary ("Asked for help on N — that's how learning works"). New `SharedUITests` SPM target ships 11 `@Test` covering the progression + per-tier text invariants (Xcode scheme-wiring step queued in `HANDOFF_TO_USER_XCODE_GUI_TASKS.md` § 6). |
| #60 | ForgeKnowledgeGraph cross-microbe ecology surfacing — `MicrobeKnowledgeGraph` (Services/, pure `nonisolated` value-type wrapper) builds a shared-habitat graph from the bundled catalog: every pair of microbes with the same `preferredEnvironment` gets a symmetric pair of `.recommended` edges. `MicrobeCodexCard` gains an optional `livesNearDisplayNames` param; discovered cards render a small "Lives near: A, B" caption. `MicrobeCodexView` builds the graph once on appear + threads neighbors through, filtering to the kid's discovered set so the codex NEVER hints at undiscovered microbes (trauma-informed posture). 9 `@Test` units in `ServicesTests/MicrobeKnowledgeGraphTests` pin construction + ordering + limit + exclude-self + unknown-slug. |
| #61 | Auto-surface SessionSummarySheet on app background — closes the FEATURE_PLAN.md § Parent Integration → "Session closer" follow-up. `AppRootView` stamps `sessionStartedAt` + `sessionStartXP` on cold launch + every `.background → .active` resume; on `.background` the productivity gate (`captureSessionSummaryIfProductive`) requires elapsed ≥ 60s AND XP earned > 0; the next `.active` surfaces `pendingSessionSummary` via `.sheet(isPresented:)` UNLESS the daily-cap / welcome-back / streak-rescue overlays hold centered-overlay precedence. Trauma-informed: short backgrounds (notification check) NEVER fire the summary; quiet sessions (0 XP) NEVER fire it. |

Net additions: 1 new Services module (`MicrobeKnowledgeGraph`) + 1 new SharedUI module (`QuestionHintStrategy`) + 1 new SharedUITests SPM test target (scheme wiring queued in handoff doc) + 20 new unit tests (11 `QuizMachineHintTests` + 9 `MicrobeKnowledgeGraphTests`) + 2 ForgeKit modules promoted from declared-but-unused → actively consumed (`ForgePedagogy` → SharedUI; `ForgeKnowledgeGraph` → Services). Build green at each merge.

**Previous round (2026-06-12, PRs #52 → #56, fourth-pass safety + Phase-1 polish)**: 5-PR sweep — Xcode-managed file safety 4th-pass + ForgeCelebration coordinator + DailyTimeCoordinator + Declared Age Range API gate scaffold + OSSignposter perf probes. See git log for the full per-PR notes; cross-references preserved in CLAUDE.md + FEATURE_PLAN.md.

**Pre-2026-06-12 PR #51**: Read-only accessibility audit (`Docs/AUDIT_ACCESSIBILITY_PASS_2026-06-12.md`) — covered every SwiftUI surface shipped through PR #50, verdict PASS WITH GAPS (Dynamic Type + color contrast portfolio-wide PASS; 3 prioritized gaps remain).

**Earlier 2026-06-12 (PRs #28 + #29 + #30)**: Phase-1 question kits 02 (microbiome), 03 (immune defense, trauma-informed register), and 04 (beneficial microbes) shipped — each as its own auto-cycle PR with bundled JSON in `Services/Resources/`, `QuestionKitService.phase1KitSlugs` extended in canonical order, and new `QuestionKitServiceTests` coverage (9/9 pass). FEATURE_PLAN.md § Gamification kit-bundling work item closed. CLAUDE.md Xcode-managed-file safety table (workspace + scheme + test plan) is the canonical reference — the user reinforced this guard at session start.

**Earlier this day (PRs #25 + #26)**: Mentor (Cilia) cue refreshes on `MicrobiomeView` feeding-mode change + every-5th-tick milestone + on `ImmuneGameView` wave-clear / run-complete. Phase-1 achievements `fiberPioneer` / `sugarTrial` / `microbiomeSteady` / `immuneRookie` / `immuneRunner` auto-evaluate as the kid hits criteria; XP awards flow through `GamificationService.evaluateAchievements`. Doc-path drift (`Libraries/Package.swift` → `Packages/Libraries/Package.swift`) corrected across CLAUDE.md + TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md + FEATURE_PLAN.md + APP_SPECIFIC_NOTES.md. Pre-existing `MacrophagePacmanSceneTests.spawnIsReproducibleAcrossSeeds()` failure (UUID-identity drift) fixed by comparing the deterministic `(kind, position, velocity)` projection.

Still declared but unused in Swift code (deps stay in `Package.swift` so future wiring is friction-free):

- `ForgeAdventure` — awaits the Life Zone hub-contribution wiring (FEATURE_PLAN.md § Adventure Mode)
- `ForgeNavigation` — TabView's native iOS 26 chrome covers Phase 1; lift when nav grids land

## Outstanding (Phase 1 trail)

These remain unchecked in `Docs/FEATURE_PLAN.md`:

| Item | Blocker / Plan |
|---|---|

| Declared Age Range API gate (iOS 26.2+) | **Scaffold landed PR #55**. Live `await requestAgeRange(...)` blocked on (a) entitlement provisioning via Xcode GUI per `HANDOFF_TO_USER_XCODE_GUI_TASKS.md` § 6b, (b) COPPA consent + retention surface (receiving "Under 13" creates actual knowledge) |
| Adventure Mode (Life Zone) wire-up | Awaits AdventureHub Level 1 config + Level 2 Swift overlay handoff |
| Performance profiling (16ms tier transition / 8ms sim tick) | **Signposts landed PR #56**. Real-device Instruments capture + bench-harness assertions still pending |
| UI tests / accessibility XCUITests | Best landed once portrait pack ships (UI tests rely on rendered assets) — accessibility audit already PASS WITH GAPS per `Docs/AUDIT_ACCESSIBILITY_PASS_2026-06-12.md`; GAP 1 closed PR #69 |
| Juice layer audio axis (SFX pack) | Asset-blocked on labsmith SFX bundle handoff per `.claude/rules/forgekit.md` § Asset generation ownership; coordinator is wired and ready (SFX dispatch closure parameter defaults nil) |
| Parent progress dashboard (per-standard proficiency) | Awaits per-question attempt log persistence; `ProgressReportService` already exposes the standards list + `StudentReportData.standardProficiencies` will pick up when the log lands |

## Sequencing Constraints

- **AvatarStudio integration** awaits the ForgeKit 0.99-series `AvatarStudioView` portrait pack distribution per `.claude/rules/forgekit.md` § Avatar Edit Authority
- **Microscope portrait pack** is a single asset wave per `.claude/rules/forgekit.md` § Asset generation ownership; labsmith generates + ships via cross-repo PR
- **Trauma-informed sensitivity review** for Phase 3 disease-story arcs per `Docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` § Trauma-Informed Design Posture — gated R0 reviewer signoff per portfolio ADR-012 / ADR-016 (MicrobeLab is trauma-AWARE not trauma-gated, so the gate applies at Phase 3 only)
